# Quantum-Enhanced Portfolio Optimization for Vanguard

## Challenge: Quantum-Enhanced Portfolio Optimization for Vanguard
Harness hybrid quantum-classical algorithms to revolutionize portfolio construction.

## Problem & Context
Vanguard’s portfolio construction process balances risk, return, and investor preferences across a vast landscape of assets. But as portfolios grow in scale—thousands of securities, strict guardrails, and real-time trading demands—classical optimization tools like GUROBI hit limits in speed, scalability, and solution diversity.

## Objectives
Develop a hybrid quantum-classical prototype that:
* Efficiently solves high-dimensional, constraint-heavy portfolio problems with binary decision variables and quadratic objectives.
* Delivers near-optimal allocations under tight runtime windows.
* Scales to real-world use cases such as fixed income ETF creation and index tracking.
* Preserves key metrics such as tracking error, excess return, and risk exposure.

## Deliverables
### Required to Pass:
1. Review the provided binary optimization formulation with linear constraints and quadratic objectives.
2. Reformulate it into a quantum-compatible, unconstrained problem.
3. Implement a quantum optimization program (e.g., Variational Quantum Eigensolver or equivalent).

### Optional Challenges:
4. Solve the problem using your quantum formulation.
5. Validate results with a classical optimizer, comparing solution quality, convergence, and scalability.
